/* About the data folder */

// In this case, we've created this json file because there you can add the projects what you did and these are the steps to follow.

//1. At folder "src" create the folder "data" 
//2. create a json file "portfolio.json"
//3. Go to "public" folder and create another folder inside this called "porfolio"
//4. Create another folder and call it with the name of the other project. 
//5. Add the screenshot of this image of the project REMEMBER, each project has to repeat the same step. 
//6. Return to "src"-"data"-"porfolio.json and add the next code: 
	
	{
    		"portfolio": [
        		{
            	"cover": /*add the route of the file for example:*/ "/portfolio/ECommerce/e-commerce.png",
            	"title": /*add a tittle of project to identify it, for example: */"E-Commerce",
            	"description": /*add a description*/ "this project has created with HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript with a responsive design",
            	"url": "https: /*add the url of the project*/ "sbarriosp.github.io/e-commerce-Frontend/"
        		}

				// there you can repeat it.
				        		{
            	"cover": /*add the route of the file for example:*/ "/portfolio/ECommerce/e-commerce.png",
            	"title": /*add a tittle of project to identify it, for example: */"E-Commerce",
            	"description": /*add a description*/ "example",
            	"url": /*add the url of the project*/ "http:example.com
        		}
    		]
	}

Repeat it with all projects that you have.
